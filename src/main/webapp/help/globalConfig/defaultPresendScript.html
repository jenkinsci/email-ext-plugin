	is available as <tt>logger</tt>. The <em>trigger</em> that caused the email
        is available as <tt>trigger</tt> and all triggered builds are available
        as a map <tt>triggered</tt>.

	You may also cancel sending the email by setting the boolean
	variable <tt>cancel</tt> to true.
        <br/><br/>
