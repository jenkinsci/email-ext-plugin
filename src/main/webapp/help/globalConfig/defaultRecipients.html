<div>
	Customize the default recipient list of the email notifications.
	The plugin will use this list if none is overridden in the 
	project configuration. You may use the $DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS
	token in projects to include this default list, as well as
	add new addresses at the project level. 
	To CC or BCC someone instead of putting them in the To list, add
	cc: or bcc: before the email address
    (e.g., cc:someone@example.com, bcc:bob@example.com).
</div>
