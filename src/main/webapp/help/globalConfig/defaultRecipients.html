<div>
	Customize the default recipient list of the email notifications.
	The plugin will use this list if none is overridden in the
	project configuration. You may use the <tt>$DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS</tt>
	token in projects to include this default list, as well as
	add new addresses at the project level.
	To <em>CC</em> or <em>BCC</em> someone instead of putting them in the To list, add
	<tt>cc:</tt> or <tt>bcc:</tt> before the email address
    (e.g., <tt>cc:someone@example.com</tt>, <tt>bcc:bob@example.com</tt>).
