<div>
	This is the default email recipient list that will be used for each email that is sent.
	To <em>CC</em> someone instead of putting them in the To list, add <tt>cc:</tt> before the email address
	(e.g., <tt>cc:someone@somewhere.com</tt>).
	NOTE: this can be overridden for each email trigger type in the Advanced section.
