<div>
	This is the default email recipient list that will be used for each email that is sent.
	To <em>CC</em> someone instead of putting them in the To list, add cc: before the email address
	(e.g., cc:someone@somewhere.com).
	NOTE: this can be overridden for each email trigger type in the Advanced section.
