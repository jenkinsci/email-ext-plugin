<div>
  This is a comma separated list (optional whitespace after commas) of email addresses
  that should receive emails for this trigger.  May contain references to build parameters.
  To <em>CC</em> or <em>BCC</em> someone instead of putting them in the To list, add
  <tt>cc:</tt> or <tt>bcc:</tt> before the email address
  (e.g., <tt>cc:someone@example.com</tt>, <tt>bcc:bob@example.com</tt>).
