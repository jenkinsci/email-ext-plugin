<div>
  This is a comma separated list (optional whitespace after commas) of email addresses
  that should receive emails for this trigger.  May contain references to build parameters. 
  To <em>CC</em> or <em>BCC</em> someone instead of putting them in the To list, add
  cc: or bcc: before the email address
  (e.g., cc:someone@example.com, bcc:bob@example.com).
