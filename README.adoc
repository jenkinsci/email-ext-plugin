This plugin allows you to configure every aspect of email notifications.
You can customize when an email is sent, who should receive it, and what
the email says.

toc::[]

== Introduction

This plugin extends the https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer/[Mailer
plugin]'s functionality by giving you more control. It provides
customization of three areas:

* *Triggers* - Select the conditions that should cause an email
notification to be sent.
* *Content* - Specify the content of each triggered email's subject
and body.
* *Recipients* - Specify who should receive an email when it is
triggered.

== Questions and Issues

If you need help, please post on the
https://jenkins.io/mailing-lists/[Jenkins users mailing list] or
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/email-ext[Stack Overflow].

Report bugs and requests for enhancement in the
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins issue tracker] (no support
tickets, please). Use the `email-ext-plugin` component in the `JENKINS`
project.

== Getting Started

=== System-wide configuration

Before using this plugin from a project, you must first configure some
system-wide settings. Go to the Jenkins system-wide configuration page
(*Manage Jenkins*, *Configure System*).

The configuration for this plugin can be found in the section entitled
*Extended E-mail Notification*. This configuration should match the
settings for your SMTP mail server. This section mirrors that of the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer/[Mailer plugin] in the *E-mail
Notification* section; however, there are a few additions. The fields
labeled *Default Subject* and *Default Content* allow you to configure
the subject and content on a system-wide level. The field labeled
*Default Recipients* can be used to set a default list of email
addresses for all projects using this plugin (it can be overridden at
the project level). This can be used to greatly simplify the
configuration you need to do for all projects.

=== Project configuration

For a project to use this plugin, you need to enable it in the project
configuration page. In the *Post-build Actions* section, click on *Add
post-build action* and then select *Editable Email Notification*.

There are three main fields that you can edit when this plugin is
enabled:

* *Project Recipient List* - This is a comma (or whitespace)
separated list of email recipients. Allows you to specify a single
recipient list for each email that is sent.
* *Default Subject* - This allows you to configure a token (more
about tokens later) that can be used to easily configure all email
subjects for the project.
* *Default Content* - Same as *Default Subject*, but for the email
body instead of the subject.

=== Pipeline step

This plugin can be used from
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[Pipeline] via the
https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/email-ext/[`emailext`] step:

[source,groovy]
----
emailext body: 'Test Message',
    subject: 'Test Subject',
    to: 'test@example.com'
----

Use the `recipientProviders` parameter to add additional recipients. For
example, to add all the people who caused a change in the change set and
the user who initiated the build:

[source,groovy]
----
emailext body: 'Test Message',
    recipientProviders: [developers(), requestor()],
    subject: 'Test Subject',
    to: 'test@example.com'
----

The recipient providers from this plugin can also be used with the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer/[Mailer plugin]. For example, to add
culprits and the user who initiated the build:

[source,groovy]
----
step([$class: 'Mailer',
  notifyEveryUnstableBuild: true,
  recipients: emailextrecipients([culprits(), requestor()])])
----

== Usage

To see the advanced configuration for this plugin, click on the
*Advanced* button. This section allows you to specify recipients for
each type of email trigger as well as a pre-send script that can be used
to modify the email just prior to sending.

=== Pre-send Scripts and Post-send Scripts

This feature allows you to write a script that can modify the
https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html[`MimeMessage`]
object before or after sending the email. This allows adding custom
headers, modifying the body, etc. Predefined variables include:

* `msg` (https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html[`javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage`]) - The MIME email message object, which can be modified.
* `logger` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html[`java.io.PrintStream`]) - A `PrintStream` that can be used to log messages to the build log.
* `build` (https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractBuild.html[`hudson.model.AbstractBuild`]) - The build this message belongs to (only use with Freestyle projects).
* `run` (https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Run.html[`hudson.model.Run`]) - The build this message belongs to (may be used with Freestyle projects or Pipeline).
* `cancel` (boolean) - When set to true, cancels the sending of the email.

=== Triggers

By default, the only trigger configured is the *Failure - Any* trigger.
To add more triggers, select one from the drop-down and it will be added
to the list. Once you have added a trigger, you have several options. To
see what conditions must be met for this plugin to send an email, click
on the "?" (question mark) next to the trigger.

* *Recipient List* - Add this recipient provider if you would like
to have the email sent to the *Project Recipient List* configured above.
* *Developers* - Add this recipient provider to send the email to
anyone who checked in code for the last build. This plugin will generate
an email address based on the committer's ID and an appended *Default
user e-mail suffix* from the *Extended E-mail Notification section* of
the *Configure System* page. For example, if a change was committed by
someone with an ID of `first.last`, and the default user e-mail suffix
is `@somewhere.com`, then an email will be sent to
`first.last@somewhere.com`.
* *Requestor* - Add this recipient provider to send an email to the
user who initiated the build (if initiated by a user manually).
* *Include Culprits* - If this recipient provider _and_ the *Developers*
recipient provider are added, emails will include everyone who committed
since the last successful build.
* *Advanced* - Configure properties at a per-trigger level.
 ** *Recipient List* - A comma (or whitespace) separated list of email
address that should receive this email if it is triggered. This list is
appended to the *Project Recipient List* described above.
 ** *Subject* - Specify the subject line of the selected email.
 ** *Content* - Specify the body of the selected email.

You can also add *Script - After Build* or *Script - Before Build*
triggers to a project to use Groovy scripts to define before or after
the build whether or not the email will be sent. The script is defined
in the *Groovy Script* section of the trigger. There are four objects
added to the model for the script to use to interact with the build:

* `out` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html[`java.io.PrintStream`]): A `PrintStream` that can be used to log messages to the build log.
* `build` (https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractBuild.html[`hudson.model.AbstractBuild`]): This is the current build, usually a subclass of `AbstractBuild`.
* `project` (https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractProject.html[`hudson.model.AbstractProject`]): The project object that the current build was started from, usually a subclass of `AbstractProject`.
* `rooturl` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html[`String`]): The Jenkins instance root URL, useful for links.

The last line in the script should resolve to a boolean (`true` or
`false`). For example:

* *Script - Before Build*:

[source,groovy]
----
// this could be used to notify people that a new build is happening
build.previousBuild.result.toString().equals('FAILURE')
----

* *Script - After Build*:

[source,groovy]
----
// only send am email if the build failed and 'mickeymouse' had a commit
build.result.toString().equals('FAILURE') && build.hasParticipant(User.get('mickeymouse'))
----

[source,groovy]
----
// only send an email if the word {{ERROR}} is found in build logs
build.logFile.text.readLines().any { it =~ /.*ERROR.*/ }
----

=== Tokens

This plugin uses *tokens* to allow dynamic data to be inserted into
recipient list, subject line, or body. A *token* is a string that starts
with a `$` (dollar sign) and is terminated by whitespace. When an email
is triggered, a token in the subject or content fields will be replaced
dynamically by the actual value that it represents. Also, the value of a
token can contain other tokens that will themselves be replaced by
actual content. For instance, the `$DEFAULT_SUBJECT` token is replaced
by the text (and other tokens) that is in the *Default Subject* field
from the *Extended E-mail Notification* section of the *Configure
System* page. Similarly, the `$PROJECT_DEFAULT_SUBJECT` token will be
replaced by the value of the *Default Subject* field from the project
configuration page.

This plugin sets the email content fields with default values when you
enable it for your project. The *Default Subject* and *Default Content*
fields on the project configuration page default to `$DEFAULT_SUBJECT`
and `$DEFAULT_CONTENT` (respectively), delegating to the the system-wide
configuration from the *Extended E-mail Notification* section of the
*Configure System* page. Similarly, the per-trigger content fields
default to `$PROJECT_DEFAULT_SUBJECT` and `$PROJECT_DEFAULT_CONTENT`,
delegating to the project's configuration. Since the value of a token
can contain other tokens, this provides different points of
configuration that can allow you to quickly make changes at the broadest
level (all projects), the narrowest level (individual emails), and
in-between (individual projects).

To see a list of all available email tokens and what they display, click
on the "?" (question mark) associated with the *Content Token Reference*
in the *Editable Email Notification* section of the project
configuration page.

As of version 2.22, this plugin also supports tokens provided by the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/token-macro/[Token Macro plugin]. You can see
the available *Token Macro Plugin Tokens* below the *Extended Email
Publisher Specific Tokens* when you click on the "?" (question mark)
associated with the *Content Token Reference* in the *Editable Email
Notification* section of the project configuration page.

=== Jelly script content templates

image::docs/images/html.jpg[]

image::docs/images/txt.jpg[]

New to version 2.9 is the ability to use Jelly scripts. Jelly scripts
are powerful in that you can hook into the Jenkins API to get any
information you want or need. There are two Jelly scripts packaged with
this plugin, and it is also possible to write your own.

There are two default Jelly scripts available out of the box; one is
designed for HTML emails and the other is designed for text emails. See
the screenshots below for what these templates look like. You can
specify which script you want by using the `template` argument. The
usage for each type of script is as follows:

* Text only Jelly script: `${JELLY_SCRIPT,template="text"}`
* HTML Jelly script: `${JELLY_SCRIPT,template="html"}`

You can also write your own Jelly scripts. The Jelly scripts are
particularly powerful since they provide a hook into the Jenkins API,
including
https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractBuild.html[`hudson.model.AbstractBuild`]
and
https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractProject.html[`hudson.model.AbstractProject`].
For example on how to do this, take a look at the existing
https://github.com/jenkinsci/email-ext-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/emailext/templates/html.jelly[`html`]
and
https://github.com/jenkinsci/email-ext-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/emailext/templates/text.jelly[`text`]
scripts.

Using custom Jelly scripts (those not packaged with this plugin)
requires the cooperation of your Jenkins administrator. The steps are
relatively simple:

. Create the Jelly script template. The name of the script should be
`<name>.jelly`. It is important that the name ends in `.jelly`.
. Have your Jenkins administrator place the script inside
`${JENKINS_HOME}/email-templates/`.
. Use the `$JELLY_SCRIPT` token with the `template` parameter equal to
your script filename without the `.jelly` extension. For example, if the
script filename is `foobar.jelly`, the email content would be
`${JELLY_SCRIPT,template="foobar"}`.

Jelly script tips:

* You can get the object of other plugin actions by querying build
actions like:
`${it.getAction('hudson.plugins.fitnesse.FitnesseResultsAction')}`
* Then you need to know what all functions are allowed by this action
object and traverse through result.

=== Groovy script content templates

New to version 2.15 is the ability to use Groovy scripts. Scripts are
powerful in that you can hook into the Jenkins API to get any
information you want or need. There are two scripts with corresponding
templates packaged with this plugin, and it is also possible to write
your own.

There are two default scripts and templates available out of the box;
one is designed for HTML emails and the other is design for text emails.
You can specify which script you want by using the `script` argument;
you can also leave the default script and specify a different template
file using the `template` argument. Furthermore, you can also include a
script that does some initialization using the `init` argument. The
usage for each type of script is as follows:

* Text only Groovy script: `${SCRIPT, template="groovy-text.template"}`
* HTML Groovy script: `${SCRIPT, template="groovy-html.template"}`

You can also write your own scripts and templates. The scripts are
particularly powerful since they provide a hook into the Jenkins API,
including
https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractBuild.html[`hudson.model.AbstractBuild`]
and
https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/AbstractProject.html[`hudson.model.AbstractProject`].
For example on how to do this, take a look at the existing
https://github.com/jenkinsci/email-ext-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/emailext/templates/groovy-html.template[`html`]
and
https://github.com/jenkinsci/email-ext-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/emailext/templates/groovy-text.template[`text`]
scripts.

Using custom scripts (those not packaged with this plugin) requires the
cooperation of your Jenkins administrator. The steps are relatively
simple:

. Create the Groovy script template. The name of the script ends in the
standard extension for the language (i.e., `.groovy`). The template can
be named anything.
. Have your Jenkins administrator place the script inside
`${JENKINS_HOME}/email-templates/`.
. Use the `$SCRIPT` token with the template parameter equal to your
template filename, or in addition the script parameter equal to the
custom script name. For example, if the template filename is
`foobar.template`, the email content would be
`${SCRIPT, template="foobar.template"}`.

Refer to the following examples for doing various things with the
built-in Groovy templates:

* link:/docs/templates/jenkins-matrix-email-html.template[`jenkins-matrix-email-html.template`]
* link:/docs/templates/jenkins-generic-matrix-email-html.template[`jenkins-generic-matrix-email-html.template`]

=== Attachments

New to version 2.15 is the ability to add attachments using
https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html[the Ant pattern
matching syntax] used in many places in Jenkins. You can set a maximum
total attachment size in the *Extended E-mail Notification* section of
the *Configure System* page; otherwise, it will be unlimited.

=== Jive Formatter

link:/docs/templates/jive-formatter.groovy[`jive-formatter.groovy`]
contains methods for easy and convenient formatting of emails being sent
from Jenkins to Jive. It should be called from the *Pre-send Script*
area. Also, it doesn't seem like Jive supports text with multiple
formats, so only call one formatting method per block of text.

Either `formatLine` or `formatText` can and should be called on every
line of text that will be sent to the Jive system prior to calling
formatting methods like color or size. Please test on your own instances
of Jive and add functionality as you find it!

The following lines should be added to the *Pre-send Script* area prior
to attempting to invoke any functions:

[source,groovy]
----
File sourceFile = new File("/your/preferred/path/jive-formatter.groovy");
Class groovyClass = new GroovyClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader()).parseClass(sourceFile);
GroovyObject jiveFormatter = (GroovyObject) groovyClass.newInstance();
----
